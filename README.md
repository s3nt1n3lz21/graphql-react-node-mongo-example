## Development

Type `npm run devStart` into the terminal to run the graphQL server. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/graphiql` to access the graphQL interface. The server will automatically reload if you change any of the source files due to nodemon. Login to mongoDB atlas to see the data in the database.
